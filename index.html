    <h2>Backstory</h2>

    <p id="firstp">
      Growing up, I listened to many different types of music. With
      <strong>My dad it was 1960's,70's and 80's classic rock </strong>, and
      with my mom it was 70's and 80's disco, pop and soul music. When I was
      younger It was sort of against my will because what would just be what was
      playing. But as I got older I started to adopt my parents music taste and
      would make playlists full of the songs they played. more recently I
      discovered my own music taste. which still included those old songs, but
      with the new addition of R&B music.<em>
        I develped such a love for R&B music, specifically from the 90's.</em
      >
    </p>

    <h2>What does it mean to me?/importance</h2>

    <p id="secondp">
      The reason my parents music is important to me is because it reminds me of
      being a child. It also reflects how different they are as people and how
      differently they grew up. R&B music is important to me because it is
      mainly the music I like to sing. All the songs have a certain similar beat
      and chords that I think is so addicting. It also represents me having a
      music taste of my own.
